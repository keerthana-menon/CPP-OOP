# To-Do List
An object-oriented programming implementation of a simple to-do list. The user interacts with the program through the `TaskManager` class, which provides methods to add, remove, find, and display tasks. Each task has a name, category, and priority level ranging from 0 to 4.
The tasks are stored in a map of `Task` objects with a unique ID number as the key.
